# Problem-solving strategies

A problem-solving strategy is a plan of actions used to find a solution.

- Trail and error
- Algorithm
- Heuristic

## Trail and error

Continue trying different solutions until problem is solved

## Algorithm

Step-by-step instructions used to achieve the desired outcome

## Heuristic

General problem-solving framework

- Working backwards
- Divide-to-conquer

### Working backwards

Begin solving the problem by focusing on the end result

### Divide-to-conquer

Breaking a large task into a series of smaller steps
