# Operant Conditioning

- Associative learning (a behaviour and its consequence)
- Direct experience

## Law of effect

"Behaviours that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated, and behaviours that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated." - Edward Thorndike

## Reinforcement

Increase the repetition of the desired behaviour

- Positive: add pleasant stimulus
- Negative: remove unpleasant stimulus

## Punishment

Decrease the repetition of the desired behaviour

- Positive: add unpleasant stimulus
- Negative: remove pleasant stimulus

Physical punishment on children may cause fear and they may become more aggressive and prone to antisocial behaviour and delinquency.

## Shaping behaviour

Reward successive approximations of a target behaviour to teach/train a complex behaviour or chain of behaviours.

## Primary and secondary reinforcers

- Primary reinforces: have innate reinforcing qualities
- Secondary reinforces: have no inherent value, only has qualities when linked with a primary one

Token economies

## Reinforcement schedules

- Continuous reinforcement: receives a reinforcer each time presenting the target behaviour
- Partial reinforcement (intermittent reinforcement): doesn't get a reinforcer each time
  - Fixed (interval & ratio)
  - Variable (interval & ratio)

## Cognition and latent learning

- Latent learning: learning that occurs but is not observable in behaviour until there is a reason to demonstrate it
