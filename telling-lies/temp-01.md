Truth-Default Theory (TDT) is a framework for understanding human deception and its detection, proposing that people generally believe others unless triggered to doubt (Levine, 2014, 2022). TDT emphasizes the role of communication content over nonverbal cues in deception detection (Levine, 2014). The theory suggests that honesty is the default state, with deception occurring when motives arise (Levine, 2022). TDT identifies factors influencing vulnerability to misinformation, including belief congruity, social congruence, and message repetition (Levine, 2022). Research has demonstrated that questioning techniques can significantly impact deception detection accuracy, both enhancing and reducing it compared to meta-analytic averages (Levine, 2023). This effect has been replicated across cultures, with a South Korean study showing accuracy rates of 65% (enhanced) and 30% (reduced) compared to the meta-analytic average of 54% (Levine, 2023). These findings support TDT's predictions and highlight the importance of questioning methods in deception detection.
