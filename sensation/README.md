## Sensory receptors

Specialised neurons respond to specific type of stimuli.

## Sensation

The process or experience of perceiving through senses.

## Transduction

The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential.

## Absolute threshold

The minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to be detected 50% of the time (strong enough for sensory receptors to send nerve impulses to the brain).

## Subliminal messages

Messages are below the physiological threshold for conscious awareness (receive but not consciously aware of it).

In laboratory settings, people can process and respond to information outside of awareness. However, they have little effect on behaviour outside the laboratory.

## Difference threshold

AKA **Just Noticeable Difference (JND)**

How much difference in stimuli is required to detect a difference between them.

### Weber's law

Ernst Weber

The difference threshold is a constant fraction of the original stimulus.

## Sensory adaption

Also **Habituation**

Refers to not perceiving stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods.

## Inattentional blindness

The failure to notice something that is completely visible because of actively attending to something else and did not pay attention to other things.

## Signal detection theory

The ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in a distracting background.
