# Dreams

- Manifest
- Latent
- Collective unconscious (Carl Jung)
- May represent a state of protoconsciousness
- Lucid dreams: certain aspects of wakefulness are maintained during a dream state; dreamers become aware of the fact that they are dreaming, and as such, they can control the dream's content.
