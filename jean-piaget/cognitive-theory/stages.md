# Stages of Development in Cognitive Theory

- [Sensorimotor](#sensorimotor)
- [Preoperational](#preoperational)
- [Concrete operational](#concrete-operational)
- [Formal operational](#formal-operational)

## Sensorimotor

0-2 years

- Identifying edible and sound-making objects
- 5-8 months: developing [object permanence](#object-permanence) & stranger anxiety exhibition (a fear of unfamiliar
  people)

### Egocentrism

Think everyone sees, thinks, and feels just the self does; thus cannot take the perspectives of others.

## Concrete operational

7-11 years

- Developing logical thinking about concrete things

## Formal operational

12+ years

- Deal with abstract ideas and hypothetical situations
