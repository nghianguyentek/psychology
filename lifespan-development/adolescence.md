- Develop [adrenarche](#adrenarche) and [gonadarche](#gonadarche)
- Develop and mature [primary](#primary-sexual-characteristics) and [secondary](#secondary-sexual-characteristics) sexual characteristics
- Menarche and spermarche
- Rapid height increment

Early maturing boys tends to stronger, taller, and more athletic than their later maturing peers -> more popular, confident, and independent but greater risk of substance abuse and early sexual activity.

Early maturing girls may be teased or overtly admired -> feel self-conscious about their developing bodies -> high risk of depression, substance abuse, and eating disorders

Late blooming adolescences may feel self-conscious about their lack of physical development. Negative feelings are particularly a problem for late maturing boys, who are at a higher risk for depression and conflict with parents and more likely to be bullied

Impact of gender identity and puberty on transgender and gender-nonconforming youth are under researched.
