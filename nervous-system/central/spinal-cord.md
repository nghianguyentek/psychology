# Spinal Cord

30 segments, each connects with a specific part of the body through peripheral nervous system

- Sensory nerves: bring messages in, messages can trigger automatic reflex (withdrawal from hot, knee jerk)
- Motor nerves: send messages out to the muscles and organs

One segment was damaged all lower segments were disable -> paralysis.
