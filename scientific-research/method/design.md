# Design Experiment

- Experimenter bias
- Placebo effect
- Variables
- Selecting and assigning participants
- Ethics

Operational definition: precise description of research variables

## Experimenter bias

Refers to the possibility that a researcher's expectations might skew the result of the study.

- Single-blind study: researcher knows groups info + participant doesn't know his group
- Double-blind study: no one knows groups info

## Placebo effect

Expecting something to happen can actually make it happen (one's expectations or beliefs influence or determine their experience in a given situation)

## Variables

- Independent variable: manipulated/controlled by the experimenter, the only or most important difference between groups.
- Dependent variable: what will be measured to see how much effect the independent variable has

Expect dependent variable depends on independent variable

## Selecting and assigning participants

### Participants

The main actors participating to the experiment process.

### Random sample

A subset of a larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.

### Participant groups

- Experimental group: experimental manipulation
- Control group

### Random assignment

All participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either group.

## Ethics

### Human participants

- Sign the informed consent form (under 18, parents/legal guardians )
- Must be approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB)
- If having deception, must provide debriefing

### Animal

rodents, birds (many basic processes similar to those in humans)

- May be unethical in human participants
- Minimise any pain or distress experienced 
- Must be approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
