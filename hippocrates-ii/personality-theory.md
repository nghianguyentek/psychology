# The Personality Theory of Hippocrates

Personality traits and human behaviours are based on four separate temperaments associated with four fluids of the body:

- Choleric (yellow bile from the liver)
- Melancholic (black bile from the kidneys)
- Sanguine (red blood from the heart)
- Phlegmatic (white phlegm from the lungs)
