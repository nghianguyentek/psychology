# Personality

Refers to long-standing trails and patterns that propel individuals to consistently think, feel, and behave in specific ways

What make us unique individuals

Each person has an idiosyncratic pattern of enduring, long-term characteristics and a manner in which they interact with other individuals and the world around them

The word personality comes from the Latin word persona, a mask worn by an actor to represent or project a specific personality trait of a character instead of conceal one's identity.
