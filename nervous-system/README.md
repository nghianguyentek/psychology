# Nervous System

- The central nervous system (CNS)
- The peripheral nervous system (PNS)

## The central nervous system (CNS)

- Brain
- Spinal cord

## The peripheral nervous system (PNS)

- Somatic: transfer sensory and motor signal to and from CNS
- Autonomic: control the function of organs and glands
  - Sympathetic division: fight or flight
  - Parasympathetic division: normal functioning under relaxed conditions

## Brain

- Hemispheres: (left & right)
- Corpus callosum
- Frontal
- Parietal
- Temporal
- Occipital

CT, PET, MRI, fMRI, and EEG

## Spinal cord

30 segments, each connects with a specific part of the body through peripheral nervous system

- Sensory nerves: bring messages in, messages can trigger automatic reflex (withdrawal from hot, knee jerk)
- Motor nerves: send messages out to the muscles and organs

One segment was damaged all lower segments were disable -> paralysis.

## Hemispheres

![img.png](hemispheres.png)

- Left controls right and right controls left
- Left: memory, selective attention, positive emotions
- Right: Pitch perception, arousal, negative emotions

corpus callosum - a thick band (about 200 mils) of neural fibers (axon)
