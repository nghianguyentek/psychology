# Brain and Memory

![img.png](brain.png)

## Engram

the group of neurons that serve as the "physical representation of memory"

## Equipotentiality hypothesis

if part of one area of the brain involved in memory is damaged, another part of the same area can take over that memory function

## The amygdala

regulate emotions, such as fear and aggression & processing emotional information

storage is influenced by stress hormones & memory consolidate (encode emotional memories at a deeper level)

## The hippocampus

- spatial memory
- project information to cortical regions that give memory meaning and connect them with other memories
- consolidate new learning memory (declarative & semantic memories - i.e., explicit memories)

## The cerebellum and prefrontal cortex

- Implicit memories: procedural, motor learning, classical conditioning

## Neurotransmitters

## Flashbulb memory

an exceptionally clear recollection of an important event
