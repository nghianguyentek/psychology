# Emotions

Emotions are energy in motion.

A subjective state of being that we often describe as our feelings.

Emotions result from the combination of subjective experience, expression, cognitive appraisal, and physiological responses.

Often begin with a subjective experience (often an external stimulus)

One expresses his emotions through verbal or nonverbal behaviours.

## Mood

Refers to a prolonged, less intense, affective state that does not occur in response to something we experience.
