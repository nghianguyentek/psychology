# Surveys

Lists of questions to be answered by research participants

## Forms

- Paper-and-pencil questionnaires
- Administered electronically
- Verbally

## Process

- Find the centre tendency (mode, median, and mean) from the samples to infer the generation of the population
- Prefer mean
- Should pay attention in the effects of outliers on means

## Advantages

- Ease of administrating -> large data (more chance to reflect more accurate -> better generalising)

## Disadvantages

- Less specific (deep)
